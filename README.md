# UfoJavascript

## Overview

### The overview of this project was to do use javascript and html to build a dynamic and in depth website to filter UFO sightings. 

## Results

The results of this project was a webiste where you could filter through different UFO sightings. For instance you have the ability to do filter through the city, the state, the date, the country, as well as even the shape of the UFO sighting. It's very simple to preform a search for the sight. For instance if we wanted to see only UFO sightings in El Cajon California that happened January 1st 2010 in the shape of a triangle we have the ability to do that. When we check the images of the website we see that in clearly indicates where we are able to do that by letting us type in that information and filtering it in that way. 

## Summary

One drawback that website has is that it doesn't give a lot of description on the UFO sighting itself. One recommendation that I have for the website is to provide some sort of further evidence for the sighting whether that be images, videos, or even comments from the people that have seen. I think to further that even an article where it's applicable. Another drawback I think the website has is there's no way to filter the duration. I think this would help the website because you'd be able to find places that had the longest duration of a UFO sighting.
